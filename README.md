## üåç Climate Change Forecasting ‚Äì Time Series Project
This project explores time series forecasting of climate data using a combination of geospatial analysis and predictive modeling. It includes data exploration, model experimentation, and an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

## üåê Streamlit App
The final model was deployed using Streamlit, resulting in an interactive web interface.
Users can select a country from the dataset and specify how many months ahead they want to predict. The app returns the corresponding forecasted temperature values.

This project was developed as part of an academic course and reflects both technical modeling and thoughtful UX design for communication.
